.  🎯 Efficient Frontier – Monte Carlo simulations of 50,000+ portfolios with Sharpe ratio maximization & minimum volatility portfolios.

.  🌱 ESG Integration – Adds environmental, social, and governance factors to guide portfolio construction.

.  📊 Visualization Dashboard – Correlation heatmaps, portfolio return distributions, and efficient frontier plots.

.  🛠️ Configurable Framework – Easily extendable for different assets, constraints, and ESG scoring methods.

## 📊 Outputs:

.  Optimal portfolio allocations (Max Sharpe, Min Volatility, Equal-Weight).
